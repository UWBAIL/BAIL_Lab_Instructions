This guide outlines the necessary steps for submitting work-related expenses for reimbursement. Following this process ensures that your submission is complete, accurate, and processed in a timely manner.

## Step 1: Obtain Pre-Approval and Funding Code

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">
**This is a mandatory first step.** Do not make any purchases before receiving a funding code. Expenses incurred without prior approval may not be eligible for reimbursement.
</div>

Before incurring any expenses, you must:

1.  **Contact Professor Wang** to request approval for your purchase.
2.  Provide a clear description of the business purpose and an estimated cost.
3.  Obtain the correct **`worktag`** for your expense. This code is required to allocate the funds correctly.

## Step 2: Collect Detailed Documentation

Proper documentation is critical for a successful reimbursement. You must retain and provide itemized receipts for all expenditures. A credit card statement showing only the total charge is not sufficient.

### Standard Requirements for All Expenses

For every purchase, your documentation must clearly show:
*   **Proof of Purchase**: An itemized receipt showing the vendor, transaction date, and a line-by-line list of items purchased.
*   **Proof of Payment**: Evidence that you paid the amount (e.g., the "amount paid" section of the receipt).
*   **Business Purpose**: A brief but clear explanation of why the expense was necessary for your work or research.

### Example: Rideshare Services (Lyft, Uber)

For rideshare expenses, you must provide a screenshot of the final ride receipt that includes all of the following information:

*   **Date and Time**: The exact date and time of the trip.
*   **Where**: The pickup and drop-off locations. A map of the route is ideal.
*   **Why**: A clear business justification for the trip (e.g., "Travel from hotel to conference venue").

## Step 3: Submit Your Reimbursement Request

Once you have gathered all your documentation and have your `worktag`, you can proceed with the official submission process through the university's finance portal.

The official forms, policies, and submission portal are located at the link below. Please review the university's requirements carefully, especially the **45-day submission deadline** for all expenses.
