## Our Mission

The **Biophotonics and Imaging Laboratory (BAIL)** at the University of Washington is a research laboratory dedicated to developing novel and clinically useful biomedical imaging techniques. Our primary goal is to advance healthcare by creating tools for the early diagnosis, treatment, and management of human diseases.

We operate at the intersection of engineering, physics, and medicine, focusing on translating cutting-edge optical technologies from the laboratory bench to the patient bedside.

## What We Do

Our research encompasses a multi-disciplinary approach to solving critical challenges in medicine. Key areas of our work include:

*   **Developing Novel Imaging Systems:** We design and build next-generation imaging devices that can visualize biological processes at the cellular and molecular levels.
*   **Clinical Translation:** In close collaboration with clinicians, we adapt and apply these technologies to address unmet needs in fields such as oncology, ophthalmology, and cardiology.
*   **Computational Imaging:** We create advanced algorithms and software to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by our imaging systems, extracting meaningful and actionable information.
